              Though my own journey has taken me across a vast spectrum of specialization and potential careers, technology has always been a fixture in my life. But after I built my first computer out of spare parts when I was ten, something took hold in me that has yet to let go.

              In early 2020, I decided to add software engineer to my collection of skillsets. This turned out to be the best decision I ever made.  Having such a diverse background as given me a vast range of mindsets and tools to solve a variety of software problems.

              The multitasking I learned as a fine-dining chef helped me grasp asynchronous programming. My skills as an editor contributed directly to my obsession with refactoring. As a writer and poet,  I am able to approach my development projects with the care and efficiency of a craftsman.

              My time at NSS has taught me more than just a technical skill. It has invigorated me with a passion for learning and growing, a passion that will follow me for the rest of my life.
